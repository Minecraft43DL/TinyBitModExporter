TINYBIT IS A SIMPLE BATCH SCRIPT WHICH MOVES ALL THE MODS FROM THE SAME DIRECTORY AS A SOURCE CODE FILE
(WHERE YOU PUT 'tinybit.bat' FILE) TO mods FOLDER IN .minecraft - INSTEAD OF MANUALLY MOVING THE FILES YOU CAN USE THIS SCRIPT.
HAVE A NICE DAY!! :D

WARNING! FOR NOW... REMEMBER TO HAVE ONLY MOD FILES (.jar) IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THAT BATCH FILE.
